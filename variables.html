    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Variables are used in every day life, and just knowing about them will unlock a whole other world of mathematics.</p>
    <div class="hspace"></div>
    <h2 id="wvariables">What Exactly are Variables?</h2>
    <p>Variables are 'substitutes' for unknown values. They are most commonly used as letters (A-Z), but mostly <b>x, y, and z</b>. For example, to find the area of a rectangle, you use 
      this formula: A = L x W. A is the area, L is the length, and W is the width. Here is another example: 2 + X = 5. We are trying to solve for X, but it is not alone on one side 
      of the equals sign. <i>Go <a href="#example">here</a> to learn about how to solve it.</i>
    </p>

    <h2 id="equation">How to Solve Equations</h2>
    <p>Solving equations means to find the value of the variable. To do this, you must have the variable on one side of the equation with <b>nothing next to it</b> except 
      for the equals sign. <br><br> <span id="example">Here is the example from earlier: </span>2 + X = 5. See how 'X' is next to 2? We need to get 2 to the other side of the 
      equation to isolate 'X'. To do that, we need to use <b>INVERSE OPERATIONS!</b> They are basically the opposite of the number. The opposite of 2 is -2, so we subract two from 
      both sides. This leaves us with X = 5 - 2  ->   X = 3! We solved for X!
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>No try to solve your own! Solve for X: X - 5 = 17 :</p>
