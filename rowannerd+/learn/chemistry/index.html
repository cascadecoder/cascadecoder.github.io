Chemistry outlines the fundementals of subatomic particles and other small things, such as the 
structure of molecules and everyday things.

<h3 id="watom"">What are Atoms?</h3>
<p class="left">
Atoms are the smallest paritcles of matter that make up everything. They are made of
subatomic particles, which are <a href="#subpart">protons, neutrons, and electrons</a>.
</p>
<div class="mspace"></div>

<h3 id="subpart">Subatomic Particles</h3>
<p class="left">
Subatomic particles make up the atom. Negatively charged electrons circle the atom, 
while positive protons and neutral neutrons are found in the nucleus which is in the center
 of the atom. Protons and neutrons both weigh 1 AMU, or Atomic Mass Unit. Electrons are 0
 AMUs because they are so tiny they only make about 1/100000 of a proton or neutron. 
The area in which the electrons circle is called the electron cloud. Because there is a 
lot of space between the nucleus and the electron cloud, you could say atoms are mostly 
empty space.

<h3 class="left" id="ptable">The Periodic Table</h3>
<p class="left">
The periodic table organizes and categorizes all the different elements.
<div class="mspace"></div>
<img src="https://texample.net/media/tikz/examples/PNG/periodic-table-of-chemical-elements.png" alt="Periodic Table">
<div class="mspace"></div>
The letters in the center of each box is the chemmical symbol, kind of like the element's 
initials. The Number in the top of the box is called the Atomic Number, which tells the  
number of protons. The mass number (the other number in the box) is the sum of the 
protons and neutrons. You can subtract the atomic number from the atomic mass to 
find the number of neutrons. The numbers lining the top of the whole table are the group 
numbers, which tell how many <a href="#electrons">valence electrons</a> there are. 
The numbers on the side tell how many <a href="#shells">shells</a> there are.
</p>

<h3 class="left" id="melectrons">More About Electrons</h3>
<p class="left">
Electrons move around the atom, and the path they move around is called a <b><span id="shells">shell. </span></b>
Period numbers (the numbers on the side of the periodic table) tell how many shells there 
are with a certain atom. The first shell (the shell closest to the nucleus) can hold up to 
two electrons. All the other shells can hold up to 8. <b><span id="electrons">Valence electrons </span></b>
are the electrons on the outermost shell (farthest from the nucleus). They are told by 
the <a href="#ptable">group number</a>, or the numbers at the top of the table. Valence  
electrons are basically the cause of <a href="#reactions">chemical reactions</a>.
</p>
<div class="mspace"></div>
<h3 id="reactions">Chemical Reactions</h3>
<p class="left">
Atoms (or elements) that have 8 valence electrons have the least amount of reactiveness. However, elements with 1 or 7 valence electrons are the most reactive. Why? Because 
every element wants to have 8 valence electrons. So atoms with 1 valence electron 
send out their valence electron to go to an atom with 7 valence electrons. This is called a <b>Chemical Reaction</b>. You can tell if a chemical reaction happened because the 
arrangment of atoms have changed. When a reaction happens, a new substance if formed.

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://texample.net/">texample.net</a> for the periodic table, and to my science teacher for teaching me this!</p>
